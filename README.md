## ◼ Dataset

- Face Dataset

① [RFW(Real Faces in-the-wild) dataset](http://www.whdeng.cn/RFW/index.html): Datasets consist of four different races for deep face recognition (African, Asian, Caucasian, Indian)

② [Face Spoofing DB](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/4/661)

③ [IAS-Lab RGB-D Face](http://robotics.dei.unipd.it/reid/index.php/8-dataset/9-overview-face) The training dataset consists of 26 subjects captured in 13 different conditions (with pose, light and expression variations), standing 1 or 2 meters from the sensor. The testing dataset contains 19 subjects and just four of them were also present in the training dataset. 

④ [AT&T](https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/att_face_dataset/): gray scale, 400 samples

⑤ [Cas-Peal pose](http://www.jdl.ac.cn/peal/index.html): Datasets consists of subjects captured in many different conditions (with pose, expression, accessory, and etc.), gray scale

- Masked Face Dataset

300 images from 50 persons(each 6 images) wearing masks

We set 2 scenarios of how people wear masks: wearing masks with the entire nose covered, when wearing masks with the nose tip visible, and then took pictures from above, front, and low
